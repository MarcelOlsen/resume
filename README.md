## About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm Marcel, and I‚Äôve always been passionate about computer science. Web development, in particular, excites me as it blends creativity with technical skill. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, with a stronger inclination towards the front-end. When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy indoor climbing, playing guitar, and making coffee.
